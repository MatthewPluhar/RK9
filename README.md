This project aims to qive researchers and students an open-source alternative to more expensive quadrupedal robotic dogs.
If anyone is interested in cooperating they are more than welcome to reach out.
More documentation, a part list and assembly instruction is coming soon. 

Unfortunately this is a self funded project meaning that my funds are limited, but if there is any interest from the community I will put more time and money into this project perhaps sell kits in the future.
